# Chainlink Fall Hackathon (October 14 - November 18): Transparent requests on mongodb database
## Tech-Stack
- Solidity for smart contract on EVM which traces interaction with data and thus making requests on data transparent
- MongoDb Atlas for NoSQL database and serverless database API
- Chainlink's External Adapter as middleman between smart contract and database

## Motivation
- 

## Alternative project
- MoodyElon is a dynamic NFT which changes baased on the sentiment of Elon's tweets
- To enable the dynamicness, one needs Chainlink's Automation service (Upkeeper)

## Next steps
- generalise smart contract so that anyone can sell personal data fairly by registering url 
- create an external adapter so that the fairData protocol firstly needs to authenticate before being able to send get reuqests
-
